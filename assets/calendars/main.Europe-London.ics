SUMMARY:18th HiRSE Seminar - Neil Chue Hong: Can Software Metrics Improve 
 Software Quality?
UID:7ced478c-79c7-4be6-a14d-93e02d3a71ef@7ced.org
DESCRIPTION:Software quality in computational science and engineering can 
 be interpreted in two ways: does the software implement the algorithm or 
 simulate the phenomenon as expected\, and does it perform as expected i.e.
  does it scale\, is it maintainable\, is it secure?\n\nSoftware metrics 
 are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant 
 property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements 
 based on the analysis of source code. Others\, such as those being 
 developed by the CHAOSS initiative\, focus on measuring the ability of a 
 project to deliver software that meets various criteria\, such as 
 community health or development efficiency.\n\nA key question is how 
 useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to 
 development in computational science and engineering\, which can differ 
 from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear 
 requirements\, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures\, and 
 focus on performance.\n\nI will consider which types of software metric 
 might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers 
 working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be 
 identified by considering the differences in the way that software is 
 developed these fields?
LOCATION:The talk will be held online. The connection details will be 
 posted on a variety on channels shortly before the event (see 
 <https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/series/2023_06_27-seminar_18.html> for a

SUMMARY:Educating Engineers for Safe AI Workshop (Cambridge)
UID:bc479706-8e6a-4217-9ca5-5b1df1ba9298@bc47.org
DESCRIPTION:The Alan Turing Institute\, Edinburgh\, Newcastle\, Cambridge 
 and UCL Universities are organising a series of workshops to discuss 
 Educating Engineers for Safe AI.\n\nWe are seeking participants in this 
 workshop series who are:\n\n- AI Engineers\, Data Scientists\, Systems 
 Engineers\, ML-Ops\, Research Software Engineers\, Site Reliability 
 Engineers and more\, working in the implementation of AI systems OR\n- 
 Academics and other experts working in areas related to Safe\, Ethical\, 
 Reliable and Trustworthy Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
 OR\n- Academics and other experts working in professional education\, 
 CPD\, and related areas\, interested in developing materials related to 
 safe AI for professional audiences.\nThe workshops consist of two regional
  nonresidential satellite workshops in Cambridge (4th July) and in 
 Edinburgh (29th June)\, and a final residential workshop in Newcastle on 
 the 15th and 16th August.\n\nThe purpose of the workshop series is to 
 develop a roadmap toward the creation of a syllabus and set of 
 professional education materials\, targeted at software and systems 
 engineers\, so that they can be empowered to champion the creation of 
 safe\, ethical and trustworthy AI in their workplaces. Developers and 
 engineers\, appropriately empowered and skilled\, are uniquely placed to 
 ensure that the systems they build are done so according to emerging 
 ethical best practice. These materials will become part of The Turing Way 
 project.

UID:dece0aea-737d-4120-875c-35b86fb5b203@dece.org
DESCRIPTION:How to install high-performant software on a High Performance 
 Cluster?\n\nSoftware installation on a High Performance Cluster (HPC) is 
 different from the usual software installation on a desktop \ncomputer.In 
 order to get the best performance out of the very expensive hardware\, it 
 is best to compile software from source\, \nrather than using pre-compiled
  binaries. This sounds often easier than it actually is. One good example 
 is Basic Linear Algebra \nSubprograms (BLAS) [1]: A generic installation 
 will only deliver a very low performance. Optimising the compile process 
 will \ndeliver more performance. However\, with the sheer amount of 
 different CPUs around\, testing it for each new build with a new 
 \ncompiler is time consuming.\n\nThe solution here is to fall back what 
 others have done\, improve on it if possible and contribute back to the 
 community.\n\nOne such an example is EasyBuild [2]: software which is 
 installing high-performant scientific software on HPC clusters 
 \nautomatically.\n\nThe talk will take you through an often a bit 
 personally journey of scientific software installation\, without too much 
 of technical \njargon. It is aimed for scientists who are installing 
 software\, or write their own code. Equally\, researchers who are more 
 \nexperienced in software installation might learn something new as well.
